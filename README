These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and Ubuntu 14.04LTS.
Android builds require a 64-bit install.  You should read through all the
material at https://source.android.com/source/building.html (and everything
at https://source.android.com/source/ if you can). I've found
their disk space requirements to be a little excessive: currently, the
Freescale build for the UIB board and a separate build for the generic
emulator, plus all the sources and ccache space uses 100GB.


1. Install all the tools as described for your system at
   https://source.android.com/source/building.html

2. Install all the AOSP sources as described at
   https://source.android.com/source/building.html and in the Freescale document
   Android_User's_Guide.pdf Chapter 3.  Note that we are currently using
   uib_6dq-eng as the product target, so running lunch should be deferred
   until after step #3.

3. Install the UIB sources.  I currently maintain three github repositories
   for the linux kernel, uboot, and Android modifications for the UIB.  Assuming
   $ANDROID is the location of your Android source tree:

# in kernel_imx
cd $ANDROID/kernel_imx
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "pwood"]
    url = https://github.com/patrickhwood/linux.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pwood/*
[branch "kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib"]
    remote = pwood
    merge = refs/heads/kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib
EOF
git pull pwood
git checkout kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib

# in bootable/bootloader/uboot-imx
cd $ANDROID/bootable/bootloader/uboot-imx
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "pwood"]
    url = https://github.com/patrickhwood/uboot-imx.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pwood/*
[branch "kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib"]
    remote = pwood
    merge = refs/heads/kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib
EOF
git pull pwood
git checkout kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib

# in device/fsl
cd $ANDROID/device/fsl
cat <<EOF >> .git/config
[remote "pwood"]
	url = https://github.com/patrickhwood/android-device-fsl.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pwood/*
[branch "imx_kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib"]
	remote = pwood
	merge = refs/heads/imx_kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib
EOF
git pull pwood
git checkout imx_kk4.4.2_1.0.0-ga-uib

4. Run the "envsetup.sh" script in build to set up the Android build environment
   variables:

 . build/envsetup.sh

   (Note the syntax: a period followed by a space and the script.)

5. Run the "lunch" command to select the uib_6dq-eng target.

 lunch uib_6dq-eng

6. Build (note: set -jN where N == the number of cores on your CPU):

 make -j4

7. Android system customizations should go into device/fsl/imx6/imx6.mk,
   device/fsl/imx6/uib_6dq.mk, or the files in device/fsl/uib_6dq/.  New apps
   should be added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES and new files (e.g., the boot animation)
   added to PRODUCT_COPY_FILES.  Any time a package is added, renamed, or
   removed, a "make installclean" should be performed to remove the disk image
   files and packages from previous builds before creating a new build.

8. Build images are placed in the out/target/product/uib_6dq directory.
   The UIB uboot binary for the DualLite is u-boot-6dl.bin, and the uboot binary
   for the Solo is u-boot-6solo.bin.  Other files such as the .img images are the
   same as in canonical Android builds.
